## Step 4: Access Your Deployed Dashboard

3. Your dashboard is now permanently available at:
   `https://trader-dashboard-yourusername.vercel.app`

## Making Updates

If you want to update your dashboard in the future:

1. Make changes to your local code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update dashboard"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Vercel will automatically detect the changes and redeploy your dashboard

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the Vercel build logs for error messages
2. Make sure your Next.js application builds successfully locally with `npm run build`
3. Verify that all dependencies are correctly listed in your package.json file
